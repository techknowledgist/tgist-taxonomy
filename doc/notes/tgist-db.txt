TGist on batcaves.org
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Created database (from cpanel)

	batcave1_tgist_SignalProcessing

	see schema at src/sql/www-schema.sql

	One thing to note is that we need utf8
		in MySQL, utf8 is not utf8, instead use utf8mb4
		with that, we cannot do an index on a varchar255 field
			instead use varchar250

Created user (from cpanel)

	batcave1_tgist/TGist0Terms

Created tables with phpMyAdmin, see

	batcave1_tgist_SignalProcessing.sql

Log in from local ssh as follows:

	$ mysql -p -u batcave1_tgist
	mysql> use batcave1_tgist_SignalProcessing

Loading tables

	1. Use the exportTables() function in tgist-taxonomy

	2. ftp to the server

	   sftp batcave1@batcaves.org

	3. data load

	   $ mysql -p -u batcave1_tgist batcave1_tgist_SignalProcessing < technologies.sql
	   $ mysql -p -u batcave1_tgist batcave1_tgist_SignalProcessing < hierarchy.sql
	   $ mysql -p -u batcave1_tgist batcave1_tgist_SignalProcessing < relations.sql

	   this is much faster than an import using phpMyAdmin
	   (about 15 seconds for the signal processing corpus)



==> Creating the same for CS 2007 patents


1. Get the features from the corpus

$ export CSPATENTS /home/j/corpuswork/fuse/FUSEData/corpora/lnus/ln-us-cs-500k
$ python extract_features.py $CSPATENTS/subcorpora/2007 Patents-2007-ComputerScience.txt &
$ python extract_features.py $CSPATENTS/subcorpora/2006 Patents-2006-ComputerScience.txt &

For 2007, started this script at 21:50 on Friday.

There are 9058 files. It should take about an hour.


2. Initialize the taxonomy and import technologies and features

There are 1.7M terms and 24M features.

First ran this as

$ java -jar dist/TGistTaxonomy.jar 
	--import 
	taxonomy-ComputerSciencePatents2007 
	/DATA/techwatch/ComputerSciencePatents2007/classify.MaxEnt.out.s4.scores.sum.az.gz 
	/DATA/techwatch/ComputerSciencePatents2007.txt.gz 

This crawls down to a halt, speed it up and make it use a few minutes only (2 or 3) by increasing memory

$ java -Xmx24g -Xms8g -jar dist/TGistTaxonomy.jar 
	--import 
	taxonomy-ComputerSciencePatents2007 
	/DATA/techwatch/ComputerSciencePatents2007/classify.MaxEnt.out.s4.scores.sum.az.gz 
	/DATA/techwatch/ComputerSciencePatents2007.txt.gz 

However, it is perhaps not a good idea to keep the features in memory at any given time. At the moment, we cannot go past probably something like 30M features (that is, about 30M features in the file to import, which translates to about 5M features in the taxonomy). Need to change the code if we need more.

Result is:
	213K technologies (6.1M)
	4.2M features (1.2G uncompressed, original file was 6G uncompressed)


3. Building the taxonomy

$ java -Xmx24g -Xms8g -jar dist/TGistTaxonomy.jar --build taxonomies-taxonomy-ComputerSciencePatents2007

At first this was not feasible because of the dumb nature of the relation extraction, which used cooccurrence in the same document. That works fine for WoS abstracts but crashes on patents where we got something like half a billion cooccurrence relations.

Relations code was changed so that instead of cooccurrence in document it used a sliding window a 2 technologies and calling those cooccurring. This will change to take sentence position into account. 

With the new code we have the following measurements:

	time elapsed:  110 seconds

	memory use:    15 GB

	relations found (tokens): 7.2M
	relations found (types):  2.8M
	after filtering:          1.5M	


4. exporting to sql


5. data load on server

   $ mysql -p -u batcave1_tgist batcave1_tgist_ComputerSciencePatents2007 < technologies.sql
   $ mysql -p -u batcave1_tgist batcave1_tgist_ComputerSciencePatents2007 < hierarchy.sql
   $ mysql -p -u batcave1_tgist batcave1_tgist_ComputerSciencePatents2007 < relations.sql

Duplicate field errors on technologies.sql:

	y
	naïve bayes (duplicate of naive bayes)	71071

	ERROR 1062 (23000) at line 211702: Duplicate entry 'fun games' for key 'PRIMARY'
		(last two not due to accents)


Other issues with technologies.sql

ERROR 1064 (42000) at line 176114: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'javascript:urllinker(”ends with=“</a>", 0.932023, 2);


NOTE: there is more to using utf8 than the scribble on top.

	see https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/mysql-utf8mb4

The other two gave no trouble.





==> And now for the CS 2002 patents


1. Get the features from the corpus

$ setenv CSPATENTS /home/j/corpuswork/fuse/FUSEData/corpora/lnus/ln-us-cs-500k
$ python extract_features.py $CSPATENTS/subcorpora/2002 Patents-2002-ComputerScience.txt &

For 2002, started this script at 18:30 on Tuesday, took about 2.5 hours.

There are 51,058 files. 

2. Initialize the taxonomy and import technologies and features

There are 5,878,347 terms and 119,281,676 features.


$ java -Xmx24g -Xms8g -jar dist/TGistTaxonomy.jar 
	--import 
	taxonomy-ComputerSciencePatents2002 
	/DATA/techwatch/ComputerSciencePatents2002/classify.MaxEnt.out.s4.scores.sum.az.gz 
	/DATA/techwatch/ComputerSciencePatents2002.txt.gz 


Using TECHSCORE=0.5f + MINCOUNT=2 ==> 1,206,211 technologies
Using TECHSCORE=0.5f + MINCOUNT=3 ==>   508,878 technologies	did this one

Import for features will not work because there are too many. Did introduce a more lightweight vector representation, which helped in the sense that instead of being able to deal with 30M feature vectors we can now go up to about 60M vectors (taking about 6 minutes and using 24GB of memory). But for this corpus we need 120M.

What we need is for the import and any code that loops over the feature to just do the loop and not build a huge data structure.

So did that...

Processing takes about 6 minutes

Result is:
	   508,878  technologies (15Mb)
	22,331,503  feature vectors (6.8Gb uncompressed)

3. Building the taxonomy

$ java -Xmx24g -Xms8g -jar dist/TGistTaxonomy.jar --build-hierarchy taxonomies/taxonomy-ComputerSciencePatents2002

Worked fine, except that there were a bunch of warnings like

	WARNING: term 'tag  ' could not be inserted

Result:

	Created 114,780 isa relations


$ java -Xmx24g -Xms8g -jar dist/TGistTaxonomy.jar --add-relations taxonomies/taxonomy-ComputerSciencePatents2002


CODE NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN TO NOT LOAD ALL FEATURES




Results:

	(currently the 2007 results)

	time elapsed:  110 seconds

	memory use:    15 GB

	relations found (tokens): 7.2M
	relations found (types):  2.8M
	after filtering:          1.5M
